Make sure to clone the repo from GitHub:  
git clone https://github.com/Bzenker29/ShiftManager.git

Create your own branch so you do not push directly to main:

```
git branch "branch name"

```

Once you make a push from your branch make sure to get oversight and merge with main:

```
git checkout main
git merge branch "branch name"
git push origin main
```
